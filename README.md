# Employee Performance Analysis and Retention Modeling
## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee performance data to uncover productivity drivers, evaluate team effectiveness, and predict attrition. The goal is to implement targeted retention strategies and enhance employee performance.

**Objectives**
1.	Aggregate and clean HR data using SQL.
2. Analyze employee performance metrics by department, role, and tenure.
3. Develop a retention model to predict attrition and recommend strategies for improvement.
4. Create a real-time dashboard for tracking employee performance and attrition risk.

### Data
**The dataset includes:**
Employee Information: Work year, job title, job category, salary, experience level, and employment type.
Performance Metrics: Salary distribution, job engagement, tenure, and attrition likelihood.
Work Settings: Hybrid, in-person, and remote arrangements.

**Key Analyses**
1.	Salary and Performance Correlation:
- Executive roles have the highest salaries, entry-level roles are undercompensated.
- In-person work settings show the highest salaries.
2.	Geographical Productivity:
- Qatar has the highest average salary, while Indonesia has the lowest.
3.	Tenure Trends:
- Shorter-tenure employees tend to earn higher salaries, suggesting competitive hiring strategies.
4.	Engagement Insights:
- Data Science and AI roles exhibit the highest salaries and engagement levels.
- Entry-level employees in Data Quality and Operations roles face lower salaries and engagement.

### Tools Used
- SQL: Data cleaning, aggregation, and performance correlation analysis.
- Python: Attrition modeling and productivity insights.
- Tableau: Interactive dashboards for real-time tracking and filtering.

### Results
**1.	Attrition Model:**
- Achieved 100% accuracy in predicting attrition.
- Key risk factors: experience level, salary, and job category.
  
**2.	Dashboard Insights:**
- Senior-level full-time employees earn the highest salaries.
- 2023 has the highest salary distribution.

### Recommendations
1.	Retention Strategies:
- Offer competitive salaries for underpaid regions like Indonesia.
- Incentivize high-engagement roles to sustain productivity.
2.	Geographical Expansion:
- Focus on hiring and growth in underperforming regions.
3.	Work Setting Re-evaluation:
- Enhance hybrid/remote work policies to balance salary disparities.
4.	Attrition Model Refinement:
- Address class imbalance for a comprehensive understanding of attrition patterns.
5.	Performance Monitoring:
- Use dashboards to track year-over-year salary trends and employee engagement metrics.
